Mention different links for speaker, venue and schedule at the top in the header section. 
Describe the purpose of the conference or the category of people who can get benefit from 
this conference. Add an introduction and images of the speaker, venue detail and the main
purpose of the conference on your webpage. Divide the page into sections, add header and 
footer showcasing the menu. Use proper background color that can go well with each other 
for various sections. Choose a decent font style and font color that matches the theme of
